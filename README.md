# IPL_WINNING_TEAM_PREDICTION
This program is designed to predict the IPL winning team. Data is taken and model is trained to predict with accuracy.
This project uses scikitlearn, train test split, scandardscaler, linear regression, onehotencoder, confusion matrix to train the model to predict with more accuracy i.e accuracy_score, precision_score, r2_score, mean_squarred_error, f1_score, recall_score, etc.
